                <h4>On this project</h4>
                <p>Time as a fourth dimension first appeared in Joseph-Louis Lagrange's <i>Mécanique analytique</i> (1788). He argued that one could conceptualize mechanics as existing in four dimensions&#8212;three in space and one in time. In 1908, mathematician Herman Minkowski published a foundational paper declaring time as the fourth dimension of space time, influencing theoretical physics and providing a basis for Einstein's theory of relativity. Computer vision and video processing also rely on this theory.</p>
                <p>Unlike the spatial dimensions, humans cannot navigate up and down the axis of time. Our perception of the fourth dimension is linear; we can neither experience the past nor jump into the future. As a result, the stories we tell are often linear, too. They have a beginning, middle, and end. Deviations thereof are notable to the reader, and must have a reason.</p>
                <p>To explore these reasons, I've selected nine works from the EAL232 syllabus that experiment with chronology. Some employ frame narratives, contextualizing the story with another perspective from a different time. Others move freely up and down the timeline. From grief to memory to post-modernism, these works create or enhance their effects by employing a non-linear narrative.</p>

                <h4>"A Madman's Diary"</h4>
                <h5>Lu Xun • 1918</h5>
                <p>In "A Madman's Diary," the titular madman's conviction that he lives in a society of cannibals is an allegory for the beliefs of the May Fourth Movement. Here, cannibalism symbolizes the exploitation within society. Both are validated by traditional Chinese texts. Under this reading, the madman is the only one to realize and rebuke the evils all around him.</p>
                <p>The frame narrator, on the other hand, is himself a member of the status quo. He views the madman's writing as evidence of a "persecution complex" (8). With his perspective, the reader sees the madman through that traditional lens. To those who exploit or abet exploitation, whistleblowers must be incoherent and illogical; otherwise, their questioning may affect change. Only by discrediting dissidents can the status quo persist.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the frame narrator states that the madman recovered. As the reader gets further into the story, not only is his madness called into question, but also his recovery thereof. Without the beginning section, the reader would have no reason to believe or know that the madman ever "improved." The uncertainty of his recovery raises probing questions: does he simply reassimilate? Is he pretending to assimilate to gain more credibility? Will he save the children, and if not, who will?</p>

                <h4>"The Merchant's Wife"</h4>
                <h5>Xu Dishan • 1921</h5>
                <p>Xiguan's life pushes against essentialist theories of identity. She does not wholly "belong" to India <i>or</i> China, suggesting that these categories are not clear-cut. To underscore this theme, Xu Dishan introduces a frame narrator. An educated man, he perceives Xiguan as Indian and thus is shocked when "her deportment [is] not that of an Indian woman" or when she speaks one of the Chinese languages (22). He subscribes to essentialism, viewing Xiguan as an outsider. The immutable nature of outsider/foreigner status promoted Han Chinese chauvinism, used to justify discrimination and nationalist actions. Xiguan subverts this philosophy. Being "Indian" is not inherent within her, nor is her Chinese identity unchangeable. Through the frame narration, the reader gets the full effect of this subversion.</p>
                <p>At the end of the story, Xiguan says that she is not sad at the "misfortunes" of her life. She employs Buddhist ideals to suggest that time has made the recollection pleasant, and that she became who she is because of her past. Without the frame narrator, this lesson might come across as overly didactic. Instead, she imparts these ideas by gently rebuking him when he pities her.</p>

                <h4>"The Wounded"</h4>
                <h5>Lu Xinhua • 1978</h5>
                <p>Instead of starting from the chronological beginning, Lu Xinhua begins the story right before the climax. The Xiaohua at the start of the timeline resents her mother and views their estrangement as a necessary evil: "That was when she had struggled with her own anger against her 'renegade' mother" (10). If the story began here, the reader would likely view her more unsympathetically for ruthlessly cutting herself off from her mother. At the start of the story, however, she is full of pain and regret. "Tears [form] in her eyes" and she feels "a wave of loneliness" seeing a mother comfort her daughter (9-10). This beginning emphasizes how Xiaohua harmed herself with the estrangement and establishes her as one of the titular sympathetic "wounded."</p>

                <h4>"Remorse"</h4>
                <h5>Zhang Jie • 1979</h5>
                <p>The powerful first line, "Finished," rings with finality (81). Its conciseness deepens the impact of the son's death, an oxymoronic end at the beginning of the story. By opening with the son's death, Zhang Jie centers the father's mourning. With the frame narrative, the son's life story is not just a list of events. It's both an act of love through grief and recollection and a confession of guilt as the father declares, "it was he who had pushed his son back to that corner" and an act of love through recollection. The father and son are nameless. Not only does that imply that they could be anyone in China, but it also defines their character by this parental relationship.</p>

                <h4><i>To Live</i></h4>
                <h5>Yu Hua • 1993</h5>
                <p>Many western readers find stories like <i>To Live</i> depressing; they say that only bad things happen and that it promotes a futilistic outlook. However, the frame narrative interspersed through Fugui's life story refutes this reading. First, these sections provide a brief emotional reprieve from the heavy main plot. Second, and more importantly, the acts of telling the story and listening to it impart meaning on Fugui's life. When the young narrator asks to hear more, he notes that Fugui feels "a deep happiness because someone had expressed interest in his life experience" (163). Fugui appreciates being seen and valued as a person and uses this chance to impart his wisdom. He shows that just as he was able to find happiness and move past hardship, so can the young narrator. Similarly, the frame narrator himself validates Fugui's life story. Not only does he actively engage with the tale as he hears it, but he preserves it through this novel. In a Watsonian reading, he found it important or meaningful enough to publish. The addition of the frame narrator is vital to the story's themes.</p>

                <h4>"Love Cannot Be Forgotten"</h4>
                <h5>Zhang Jie • 1979</h5>
                <p>There are multiple frame narratives in this story. In the "present," the narrator contemplates whether or not to marry. She reflects on conversations with her mother and the process of reading the notebook, declaring, "It was only after I had read through it from beginning to end that gradually, by knitting those scattered sentences together with the fragments of my memories, the indistinct shape of something emerged" (97). These embedded narratives are presented as transformational and profound. Moreover, the text of the notebook is itself another narrative, which tells the mother's unrealized love story. The amount of narratives reflects the title of the notebook, "Love Cannot Be Forgotten." Through this convoluted process of memory, writing, and discovery, the narrator preserves her mother's romance. That forbidden love is not forgotten, and neither is the concept of love itself, as the narrator resolves not to enter a loveless marriage at the story's end. </p>

                <h4>"The Doctor's Mother"</h4>
                <h5>Xu Cho-liu • 1945</h5>
                <p>"The Doctor's Mother" opens with the mother before detailing Ch'ien Hsin-fa's embrace of Japanese imperialism. Doing so in conjunction with the title positions the mother as the story's protagonist. This is not a tale of a status-seeking man losing sight of his roots. In fact, despite the amount of space dedicated to Ch'ien Hsin-fa, he's more of a tragic antagonistic force in the mother's life. With the frame narrative, he gets neither the first nor last say.</p>
                <p>The last say goes to the old beggar. The story begins with a frame narrative wherein the mother helps him out and becomes a friend. The beggar does not appear for most of the story, but Xu Cho-liu makes sure the reader knows his character up front, priming them to think he's important. That opening pays off at the mother's funeral. Because the story begins with their relationship, the reader do not question that the beggar is the "one exception" who "truly mourn[s]" her (23).</p>

                <h4>"Fin de Siècle Splendor"</h4>
                <h5>Zhu Tianwan • 1990</h5>
                <p>Zhu Tianwan employs the lyrical mode to dance around the timeline of her story with no clear pattern or delineation. Passages switch between past and present tense and jump from Mia's relationship with Duan to her youth to her girlfriends, <i>etc.</i> It's difficult to follow a plot, which tells the reader that they're not <i>supposed</i> to follow one. Instead, they should focus on the mood and imagery. This reading experience emphasizes transience via a collection of loosely organized "present" moments. A strict, linear version of this story would be incredibly dull and have much less of an impact.

                <h4><i>The Man with the Compound Eyes</i></h4>
                <h5>Wu Ming-li • 2011</h5>
                <p>On a metatextual level, Wu Ming-li reflects the titular compound eyes not only with the ommatidium sections but with his use of time. Disjoint physical spaces coexist in the man's eyes. Similarly, disjoint temporal spaces coexist in the book. Characters frequently visit the past, whether to tell stories to each other or through simple memory. Chapters 17 and 18 even switch to first-person. That section sees Alice and Atile'i communicate and bond despite a language barrier. In a book where genuine human connection is vital for characters' growth, non-linearity and the focus on the past offer a chance for emotional vulnerability.</p>
